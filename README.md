1. Paper name : "Does California's CO2 price affect wholesale electricity prices in the Western U.S.A.?"
  * Highlight: analyzed CO2 price based on cap and trade program affect to wholesale electricity price in California.
  * Data source : the market price data came from SNL Financial (www.snl.com); electricity wholesale price ($/MWhr), natural gas price ($/MMBtu)
  * Statistical analysis (correlation analysis) shows that that the day-ahead market prices are positively correlated with the day-ahead forecasts of the CO2 price, the natural gas price and PG& E and SCE system loads, but are negatively correlated with the day-ahead forecasts of California's solar generation and hydro conditions. As some of the correlations (e.g., nuclear capacities available and wind energy) are at odds with our expectations, we propose a regression-based approach below to esti- mate the CO2 price's effects
  * method: regression with random error 

  This math is inline $`a^2+b^2=c^2`$.
